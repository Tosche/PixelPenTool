This is a plugin for the [Glyphs font editor](http://glyphsapp.com/).

It's a pencil tool that draws pixels using components, making pixel font design so much easier. While FontStruct offers a similar service, there is a lot of luxury that comes with a pixel tool in Glyphs such as in-text preview. Note that it does not offer the ability to generate actual pixel font formats.

### Install

1. Install via the Plugin Manager in Glyphs.
2. Restart Glyphs.

### How to use

1. When you activate the Pixel Pen tool for the first time in your font, it will open a setting window where you can specify pixel size and metrics.

2. Open a glyph, and draw like a regular pencil tool. The Pixel Pen has auto-erase function, and will delete existing components.
